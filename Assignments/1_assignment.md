# Identify User Requirements

## Observation

You collect the data by at first observing the users performing their 
task in their current setting (you plan to help the users and improve 
the process by your application later). You need to take notes of the 
aspects important for your application, and if the users agree, you can 
also record videos of them performing their task, which you can analyze 
later. 

## Interviews

Additionally, afterwards you can perform a short interview with each 
user by asking few prepared questions concerning the problem to identify
the most critical steps, difficulties and current approach to the 
solution and collect the requirements for your application. In the 
interview you can also shortly describe the application you plan to 
develop and ask users for their suggestions for it, and whether they 
would be willing to pay for such an application.
